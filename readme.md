MONITOR PRESET SWITCH MASTER  
  Script to take Increasingly drastic measures to get AMD's Catalyst Control Center presets to work :/
  
USEAGE:  
* Create presets in AMD's Catalyst Control Center (CCC.exe)  
* Download or pull copy of Master.ahk file, (make copies) and rename them to your presets eg preset 1.ahk, ...2.ahk  
* Add it to your preferred launch thing (shortcut on desktop or start menu or Launchy etc)  
* Run script!  
  
NOTES:  
* Ahk script filename MUST match preset name which is (probably) stored here:  
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\AMD Catalyst Control Center\Presets  
* One of the measures to get presets to work includes killing the process "MOM.exe" and it's kind of like a The Binding Of Isaac reference :')  
* This is just a quick work-around script but posting here to keep active and demonstrate my improving programming ability, thanks!
